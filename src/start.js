    This component is a small info page for users to read while the app is loading.
    The app is connected to the serviceWorker and onLoad event. Note that we will always not be loaded when we mount this component FOR THE FIRST TIME.
    However, if we change route and come pack we will not call load again. Therefore we need to store a load variable which says we have loaded on rerouting.
    -----
    Each route will be pre-rendered with react-snapshot and served to client.
    Lazy loading not implemented with SSR since we need sync code in server but async in client producing mismatch when js tries to attach event handlers.
    SSR rendering will mean information is available to users and SEO instantly. Lazy loading will only remove js download and scripting time.
    The starter page acts as the shell of the application along with the navigation.
